# Submitting a Ticket

**ATTENTION:** While creating tickets is the only way to assign a task to be completed, it is equally important to not flood the development team with tickets that are not actually necessary ( might be a duplicate, already being worked on, not actually an issue, etc ).  So before you create a ticket, please check that your issue has not already been reported.

## Creating a New Item

To submit a ticket, visit the project's repo on [Github](https://github.com/CivilServiceUSA), select the **Issues** tab in the right column,  and click the green **New issue** button.

**Please use our [Ticket Template](../templates/ticket-template.md) to make sure you are entering all the information we will need to complete the item you are about to create.**
